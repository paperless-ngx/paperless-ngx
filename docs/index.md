-   **Organize and index** your scanned documents with tags, correspondents, types, and more.
-   _Your_ data is stored locally on _your_ server and is never transmitted or shared in any way.
-   Performs **OCR** on your documents, adding searchable and selectable text, even to documents scanned with only images.
-   Utilizes the open-source Tesseract engine to recognize more than 100 languages.
-   Documents are saved as PDF/A format which is designed for long term storage, alongside the unaltered originals.
-   Uses machine-learning to automatically add tags, correspondents and document types to your documents.
-   Supports PDF documents, images, plain text files, Office documents (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and LibreOffice equivalents)[^1] and more.

-   **Full text search** helps you find what you need:
    -   Auto completion suggests relevant words from your documents.
    -   Results are sorted by relevance to your search query.
    -   Highlighting shows you which parts of the document matched the query.
    -   Searching for similar documents ("More like this")
-   **Email processing**[^1]: import documents from your email accounts:
    -   Configure multiple accounts and rules for each account.
    -   After processing, paperless can perform actions on the messages such as marking as read, deleting and more.
-   A built-in robust **multi-user permissions** system that supports 'global' permissions as well as per document or object.
-   A powerful workflow system that gives you even more control.
-   **Optimized** for multi core systems: Paperless-ngx consumes multiple documents in parallel.
-   The integrated sanity checker makes sure that your document archive is in good health.

[^1]: Office document and email consumption support is optional and provided by Apache Tika (see [configuration](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/configuration/#tika))

## Paperless, a history

Paperless-ngx is the official successor to the original [Paperless](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless) & [Paperless-ng](https://github.com/jonaswinkler/paperless-ng) projects and is designed to distribute the responsibility of advancing and supporting the project among a team of people. [Consider joining us!](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx#community-support)

Further discussion of the transition between these projects can be found at
[ng#1599](https://github.com/jonaswinkler/paperless-ng/issues/1599) and [ng#1632](https://github.com/jonaswinkler/paperless-ng/issues/1632).
