older comments. The Docker image will automatically perform this reindex, bare metal installations will have to perform this manually, see [the docs](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/administration/#index)._

    want to build the docker image themselves need to change line 6 of
    the `Dockerfile` to
    `RUN npm update npm -g && npm install --legacy-peer-deps`.

## Paperless-ng

### paperless-ng 1.5.0

Support for Python 3.6 was dropped.

-   Updated python dependencies.
-   Base image of the docker image changed from Debian Buster to Debian
    Bullseye due to its recent release.
-   The docker image now uses python 3.9.
-   Added the Luxembourgish locale. Thanks for translating!
-   [Daniel Albers](https://github.com/AlD) added support for making the
    files and folders ignored by the paperless consume folder scanner
    configurable. See `PAPERLESS_CONSUMER_IGNORE_PATTERNS`.

### paperless-ng 1.4.5

This is a maintenance release.

-   Updated Python and Angular dependencies.
-   Changed the algorithm that changes permissions during startup. This
    is still fast, and will hopefully cause less issues.
-   Fixed an issue that would sometimes cause paperless to write an
    incomplete classification model file to disk.
-   Fixed an issue with the OCRmyPDF parser that would always try to
    extract text with PDFminer even from non-PDF files.

### paperless-ng 1.4.4

-   Drastically decreased the startup time of the docker container. The
    startup script adjusts file permissions of all data only if changes
    are required.
-   Paperless mail: Added ability to specify the character set for each
    server.
-   Document consumption: Ignore Mac OS specific files such as
    `.DS_STORE` and `._XXXXX.pdf`.
-   Fixed an issue with the automatic matching algorithm that prevents
    paperless from consuming new files.
-   Updated translations.

### paperless-ng 1.4.3

-   Additions and changes
    -   Added Swedish locale.
    -   [Stéphane Brunner](https://github.com/sbrunner) added an option
        to disable the progress bars of all management commands.
    -   [Jo Vandeginste](https://github.com/jovandeginste) added support
        for RTF documents to the Apache TIKA parser.
    -   [Michael Shamoon](https://github.com/shamoon) added dark mode
        for the login and logout pages.
    -   [Alexander Menk](https://github.com/amenk) added additional
        stylesheets for printing. You can now print any page of
        paperless and the print result will hide the page header,
        sidebar, and action buttons.
    -   Added support for sorting when using full text search.
-   Fixes
    -   [puuu](https://github.com/puuu) fixed
        `PAPERLESS_FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME`. You can now host paperless on sub
        paths such as `https://localhost:8000/paperless/`.
    -   Fixed an issue with the document consumer crashing on certain
        documents due to issues with pdfminer.six. This library is used
        for PDF text extraction.

### paperless-ng 1.4.2

-   Fixed an issue with `sudo` that caused paperless to not start on
    many Raspberry Pi devices. Thank you
    [WhiteHatTux](https://github.com/WhiteHatTux)!

### paperless-ng 1.4.1

-   Added Polish locale.
-   Changed some parts of the Dockerfile to hopefully restore
    functionality on certain ARM devices.
-   Updated python dependencies.
-   [Michael Shamoon](https://github.com/shamoon) added a sticky filter
    / bulk edit bar.
-   [sbrl](https://github.com/sbrl) changed the docker-entrypoint.sh
    script to increase compatibility with NFS shares.
-   [Chris Nagy](https://github.com/what-name) added support for
    creating a super user by passing `PAPERLESS_ADMIN_USER` and
    `PAPERLESS_ADMIN_PASSWORD` as environment variables to the docker
    container.

### paperless-ng 1.4.0

-   Docker images now use tesseract 4.1.1, which should fix a series of
    issues with OCR.
-   The full text search now displays results using the default document
    list. This enables selection, filtering and bulk edit on search
    results.
-   Changes
    -   Firefox only: Highlight search query in PDF previews.
    -   New URL pattern for accessing documents by ASN directly
        (<http://><paperless>/asn/123)
    -   Added logging when executing pre\* and post-consume scripts.
    -   Better error logging during document consumption.
    -   Updated python dependencies.
    -   Automatically inserts typed text when opening "Create new"
        dialogs on the document details page.
-   Fixes
    -   Fixed an issue with null characters in the document content.

!!! note

    The changed to the full text searching require you to reindex your
    documents. _The docker image does this automatically, you don't need to
    do anything._ To do this, execute the `document_index reindex`
    management command (see [Managing the document search index](administration.md#index)).

### paperless-ng 1.3.2

-   Added translation into Portuguese.
-   Changes
    -   The exporter now exports user accounts, mail accounts, mail
        rules and saved views as well.

        in regular expressions were used for the match.

-   Added translation into Spanish and Russian.
-   Other changes
    -   ISO-8601 date format will now always show years with 4 digits.
    -   Added the ability to search for a document with a specific ASN.
    -   The document cards now display ASN, types and dates in a more
        organized way.
    -   Added document previews when hovering over the preview button.
-   Fixes
    -   The startup check for write permissions now works properly on
        NFS shares.
    -   Fixed an issue with the search results score indicator.
    -   Paperless was unable to generate thumbnails for encrypted PDF
        files and failed. Paperless will now generate a default
        thumbnail for these files.
    -   Fixed `AUTO_LOGIN_USERNAME`: Unable to perform POST/PUT/DELETE
        requests and unable to receive WebSocket messages.

### paperless-ng 1.3.0

This release contains new database migrations.

-   Changes
    -   The REST API is versioned from this point onwards. This will
        allow me to make changes without breaking existing clients. See
        the documentation about [API versioning](api.md#api-versioning) for details.
    -   Added a color picker for tag colors.
    -   Added the ability to use the filter for searching the document
        content as well.

    -   Close individual documents from the sidebar. Thanks to [Michael
        Shamoon](https://github.com/shamoon).

        option to disable/enable thumbnail inversion in dark mode.

        to customize the header used for remote user authentication with
        SSO applications.

    -   Fixed an issue with the auto matching algorithm when more than
        256 tags were used.

    Paperless into Portuguese (Brazil)!
-   The date input fields now respect the currently selected date
    format.
-   Added a fancy icon when adding paperless to the home screen on iOS
    devices. Thanks to [Joel Nordell](https://github.com/joelnordell).
-   When using regular expression matching, the regular expression is
    now validated before saving the tag/correspondent/type.
-   Regression fix: Dates on the front end did not respect date locale
    settings in some cases.

### paperless-ng 1.2.0

-   Changes to the OCRmyPDF integration
    -   Added support for deskewing and automatic rotation of
        incorrectly rotated pages. This is enabled by default, see
        [OCR settings](configuration.md#ocr).
    -   Better support for encrypted files.
    -   Better support for various other PDF files: Paperless will now
        attempt to force OCR with safe options when OCR fails with the
        configured options.
    -   Added an explicit option to skip cleaning with `unpaper`.
-   Download multiple selected documents as a zip archive.
-   The document list now remembers the current page.
-   Improved responsiveness when switching between saved views and the
    document list.
-   Increased the default wait time when observing files in the
    consumption folder with polling from 1 to 5 seconds. This will
    decrease the likelihood of paperless consuming partially written
    files.
-   Fixed a crash of the document archiver management command when
    trying to process documents with unknown mime types.
-   Paperless no longer depends on `libpoppler-cpp-dev`.

### paperless-ng 1.1.4

-   Added English (GB) locale.
-   Added ISO-8601 date display option.

### paperless-ng 1.1.3

-   Added a docker-specific configuration option to adjust the number of
    worker processes of the web server. See
    [Docker options](configuration.md#docker).
-   Some more memory usage optimizations.
-   Don't show inbox statistics if no inbox tag is defined.

### paperless-ng 1.1.2

-   Always show top left corner of thumbnails, even for extra wide
    documents.
-   Added a management command for executing the sanity checker
    directly. See [management utilities](administration.md#sanity-checker).
-   The weekly sanity check now reports messages in the log files.
-   Fixed an issue with the metadata tab not reporting anything in case
    of missing files.
-   Reverted a change from 1.1.0 that caused huge memory usage due to
    redis caching.
-   Some memory usage optimizations.

### paperless-ng 1.1.1

This release contains new database migrations.

-   Fixed a bug in the sanity checker that would cause it to display "x
    not in list" errors instead of actual issues.
-   Fixed a bug with filename generation for archive filenames that
    would cause the archive files of two documents to overlap.
    -   This happened when `PAPERLESS_FILENAME_FORMAT` is used and the
        filenames of two or more documents are the same, except for the
        file extension.
    -   Paperless will now store the archive filename in the database as
        well instead of deriving it from the original filename, and use
        the same logic for detecting and avoiding filename clashes
        that's also used for original filenames.
    -   The migrations will repair any missing archive files. If you're
        using tika, ensure that tika is running while performing the
        migration. Docker-compose will take care of that.
-   Fixed a bug with thumbnail regeneration when TIKA integration was
    used.
-   Added ASN as a placeholder field to the filename format.
-   The docker image now comes with built-in shortcuts for most
    management commands. These are now the recommended way to execute
    management commands, since these also ensure that they're always
    executed as the paperless user and you're less likely to run into
    permission issues. See
    [management commands](administration.md#management-commands).

### paperless-ng 1.1.0

-   Document processing status

    -   Paperless now shows the status of processing documents on the
        dashboard in real time.
    -   Status notifications when
        -   New documents are detected in the consumption folder, in
            mails, uploaded on the front end, or added with one of the
            mobile apps.
        -   Documents are successfully added to paperless.
        -   Document consumption failed (with error messages)
    -   Configuration options to enable/disable individual
        notifications.

-   Live updates to document lists and saved views when new documents
    are added.

    !!! tip

    For status notifications and live updates to work, paperless now
    requires an [ASGI](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)-enabled
    web server. The docker images uses `gunicorn` and an ASGI-enabled
    worker called [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/), and there is no
    need to configure anything.

    For bare metal installations, changes are required for the
    notifications to work. Adapt the service
    `paperless-webserver.service` to use the supplied `gunicorn.conf.py`
    configuration file and adapt the reference to the ASGI application
    as follows:

    ```
    ExecStart=/opt/paperless/.local/bin/gunicorn -c /opt/paperless/gunicorn.conf.py paperless.asgi:application
    ```

    Paperless will continue to work with WSGI, but you will not get any
    status notifications.

    Apache `mod_wsgi` users, see
    [this note](faq.md#how-do-i-get-websocket-support-with-apache-mod_wsgi).

-   Paperless now offers suggestions for tags, correspondents and types
    on the document detail page.

-   Added an interactive easy install script that automatically
    downloads, configures and starts paperless with docker.

-   Official support for Python 3.9.

-   Other changes and fixes

    -   Adjusted the default parallelization settings to run more than
        one task in parallel on systems with 4 or less cores. This
        addresses issues with paperless not consuming any new files when
        other tasks are running.
    -   Fixed a rare race condition that would cause paperless to
        process incompletely written files when using the upload on the
        dashboard.
    -   The document classifier no longer issues warnings and errors
        when auto matching is not used at all.
    -   Better icon for document previews.
    -   Better info section in the side bar.
    -   Paperless no longer logs to the database. Instead, logs are
        written to rotating log files. This solves many "database is
        locked" issues on Raspberry Pi, especially when SQLite is used.
    -   By default, log files are written to `PAPERLESS_DATA_DIR/log/`.
        Logging settings can be adjusted with `PAPERLESS_LOGGING_DIR`,
        `PAPERLESS_LOGROTATE_MAX_SIZE` and
        `PAPERLESS_LOGROTATE_MAX_BACKUPS`.

### paperless-ng 1.0.0

Nothing special about this release, but since there are relatively few
bug reports coming in, I think that this is reasonably stable.

-   Document export
    -   The document exporter has been rewritten to support updating an
        already existing export in place. This enables incremental
        backups with `rsync`.
    -   The document exporter supports naming exported files according
        to `PAPERLESS_FILENAME_FORMAT`.
    -   The document exporter locks the media directory and the database
        during execution to ensure that the resulting export is
        consistent.
    -   See the [updated documentation](administration.md#exporter) for more details.
-   Other changes and additions
    -   Added a language selector to the settings.
    -   Added date format options to the settings.
    -   Range selection with shift clicking is now possible in the
        document list.
    -   Filtering correspondent, type and tag management pages by name.
    -   Focus "Name" field in dialogs by default.

### paperless-ng 0.9.14

Starting with this version, releases are getting built automatically.
This release also comes with changes on how to install and update
paperless.

-   Paperless now uses GitHub Actions to make releases and build docker
    images.
    -   Docker images are available for amd64, armhf, and aarch64.
    -   When you pull an image from Docker Hub, Docker will
        automatically select the correct image for you.
-   Changes to docker installations and updates
    -   The `-dockerfiles.tar.xz` release archive is gone. Instead,
        simply grab the docker files from `/docker/compose` in the
        repository if you wish to install paperless by pulling from the
        hub.
    -   The docker compose files in `/docker/compose` were changed to
        always use the `latest` version automatically. In order to do
        further updates, simply do a `docker-compose pull`. The
        documentation has been updated.
    -   The docker compose files were changed to restart paperless on
        system boot only if it was running before shutdown.
    -   Documentation of the docker-compose files about what they do.
-   Changes to bare metal installations and updates
    -   The release archive is built exactly like before. However, the
        release now comes with already compiled translation messages and
        collected static files. Therefore, the update steps
        `compilemessages` and `collectstatic` are now obsolete.
-   Other changes
    -   A new configuration option `PAPERLESS_IGNORE_DATES` was added by
        [jayme-github](http://github.com/jayme-github). This can be used
        to instruct paperless to ignore certain dates (such as your date
        of birth) when guessing the date from the document content. This
        was actually introduced in 0.9.12, I just forgot to mention it
        in the changelog.
    -   The filter drop downs now display selected entries on top of all
        other entries.
    -   The PostgreSQL client now supports setting an explicit `sslmode`
        to force encryption of the connection to PostgreSQL.
    -   The docker images now come with `jbig2enc`, which is a lossless
        image encoder for PDF documents and decreases the size of
        certain PDF/A documents.
    -   When using any of the manual matching algorithms, paperless now
        logs messages about when and why these matching algorithms
        matched.
    -   The default settings for parallelization in paperless were
        adjusted to always leave one CPU core free.
    -   Added an option to the frontend to choose which method to use
        for displaying PDF documents.
-   Fixes
    -   An issue with the tika parser not picking up files from the
        consumption directory was fixed.
    -   A couple changes to the dark mode and fixes to several other
        layout issues.
    -   An issue with the drop downs for correspondents, tags and types
        not properly supporting filtering with special characters was
        fixed.
    -   Fixed an issue with filenames of downloaded files: Dates where
        off by one day due to timezone issues.
    -   Searching will continue to work even when the index returns
        non-existing documents. This resulted in "Document does not
        exist" errors before. Instead, a warning is logged, indicating
        the issue.
    -   An issue with the consumer crashing when invalid regular
        expression were used was fixed.

### paperless-ng 0.9.13

-   Fixed an issue with Paperless not starting due to the new Tika
    integration when `USERMAP_UID` and `USERMAP_GID` was used in the
    `docker-compose.env` file.

### paperless-ng 0.9.12

-   Paperless localization
    -   Thanks to the combined efforts of many users, Paperless is now
        available in English, Dutch, French and German.
-   Thanks to [Jo Vandeginste](https://github.com/jovandeginste),
    Paperless has optional support for Office documents such as .docx,
    .doc, .odt and more.
    -   See the [Tika settings](configuration.md#tika) on how to enable this
        feature. This feature requires two additional services (one for
        parsing Office documents and metadata extraction and another for
        converting Office documents to PDF), and is therefore not enabled
        on default installations.
    -   As with all other documents, paperless converts Office documents
        to PDF and stores both the original as well as the archived PDF.
-   Dark mode
    -   Thanks to [Michael Shamoon](https://github.com/shamoon),
        paperless now has a dark mode. Configuration is available in the
        settings.
-   Other changes and additions
    -   The PDF viewer now uses a local copy of some dependencies
        instead of fetching them from the internet. Thanks to
        [slorenz](https://github.com/sisao).
    -   Revamped search bar styling thanks to [Michael
        Shamoon](https://github.com/shamoon).
    -   Sorting in the document list by clicking on table headers.
    -   A button was added to the document detail page that assigns a
        new ASN to a document.
    -   Form field validation: When providing invalid input in a form
        (such as a duplicate ASN or no name), paperless now has visual
        indicators and clearer error messages about what's wrong.
    -   Paperless disables buttons with network actions (such as save
        and delete) when a network action is active. This indicates that
        something is happening and prevents double clicking.
    -   When using "Save & next", the title field is focussed
        automatically to better support keyboard editing.
    -   E-Mail: Added filter rule parameters to allow inline attachments
        (watch out for mails with inlined images!) and attachment
        filename filters with wildcards.
    -   Support for remote user authentication thanks to [Michael
        Shamoon](https://github.com/shamoon). This is useful for hiding
        Paperless behind single sign on applications such as
        [authelia](https://www.authelia.com/).
    -   "Clear filters" has been renamed to "Reset filters" and now
        correctly restores the default filters on saved views. Thanks to
        [Michael Shamoon](https://github.com/shamoon)
-   Fixes
    -   Paperless was unable to save views when "Not assigned" was
        chosen in one of the filter dropdowns.
    -   Clearer error messages when pre and post consumption scripts do
        not exist.
    -   The post consumption script is executed later in the consumption
        process. Before the change, an ID was passed to the script
        referring to a document that did not yet exist in the database.

### paperless-ng 0.9.11

-   Fixed an issue with the docker image not starting at all due to a
    configuration change of the web server.

### paperless-ng 0.9.10

-   Bulk editing
    -   Thanks to [Michael Shamoon](https://github.com/shamoon), we've
        got a new interface for the bulk editor.
    -   There are some configuration options in the settings to alter
        the behavior.
-   Other changes and additions
    -   Thanks to [zjean](https://github.com/zjean), paperless now
        publishes a webmanifest, which is useful for adding the
        application to home screens on mobile devices.
    -   The Paperless-ng logo now navigates to the dashboard.
    -   Filter for documents that don't have any correspondents, types
        or tags assigned.
    -   Tags, types and correspondents are now sorted case insensitive.
    -   Lots of preparation work for localization support.
-   Fixes
    -   Added missing dependencies for Raspberry Pi builds.
    -   Fixed an issue with plain text file consumption: Thumbnail
        generation failed due to missing fonts.
    -   An issue with the search index reporting missing documents after
        bulk deletes was fixed.
    -   Issue with the tag selector not clearing input correctly.
    -   The consumer used to stop working when encountering an
        incomplete classifier model file.

!!! note

    The bulk delete operations did not update the search index. Therefore,
    documents that you deleted remained in the index and caused the search
    to return messages about missing documents when searching. Further bulk
    operations will properly update the index.

    However, this change is not retroactive: If you used the delete method
    of the bulk editor, you need to reindex your search index by
    [running the management command `document_index` with the argument `reindex`](administration.md#index).

### paperless-ng 0.9.9

Christmas release!

-   Bulk editing
    -   Paperless now supports bulk editing.
    -   The following operations are available: Add and remove
        correspondents, tags, document types from selected documents, as
        well as mass-deleting documents.
    -   We've got a more fancy UI in the works that makes these
        features more accessible, but that's not quite ready yet.
-   Searching
    -   Paperless now supports searching for similar documents ("More
        like this") both from the document detail page as well as from
        individual search results.
    -   A search score indicates how well a document matches the search
        query, or how similar a document is to a given reference
        document.
-   Other additions and changes
    -   Clarification in the UI that the fields "Match" and "Is
        insensitive" are not relevant for the Auto matching algorithm.
    -   New select interface for tags, types and correspondents allows
        filtering. This also improves tag selection. Thanks again to
        [Michael Shamoon](https://github.com/shamoon)!
    -   Page navigation controls for the document viewer, thanks to
        [Michael Shamoon](https://github.com/shamoon).
    -   Layout changes to the small cards document list.
    -   The dashboard now displays the username (or full name if
        specified in the admin) on the dashboard.
-   Fixes
    -   An error that caused the document importer to crash was fixed.
    -   An issue with changes not being possible when
        `PAPERLESS_COOKIE_PREFIX` is used was fixed.
    -   The date selection filters now allow manual entry of dates.
-   Feature Removal
    -   Most of the guesswork features have been removed. Paperless no
        longer tries to extract correspondents and tags from file names.

### paperless-ng 0.9.8

This release addresses two severe issues with the previous release.

-   The delete buttons for document types, correspondents and tags were
    not working.
-   The document section in the admin was causing internal server errors
    (500).

### paperless-ng 0.9.7

-   Front end
    -   Thanks to the hard work of [Michael
        Shamoon](https://github.com/shamoon), paperless now comes with a
        much more streamlined UI for filtering documents.
    -   [Michael Shamoon](https://github.com/shamoon) replaced the
        document preview with another component. This should fix
        compatibility with Safari browsers.
    -   Added buttons to the management pages to quickly show all
        documents with one specific tag, correspondent, or title.
    -   Paperless now stores your saved views on the server and
        associates them with your user account. This means that you can
        access your views on multiple devices and have separate views
        for different users. You will have to recreate your views.
    -   The GitHub and documentation links now open in new tabs/windows.
        Thanks to [rYR79435](https://github.com/rYR79435).
    -   Paperless now generates default saved view names when saving
        views with certain filter rules.
    -   Added a small version indicator to the front end.
-   Other additions and changes
    -   The new filename format field `{tag_list}` inserts a list of
        tags into the filename, separated by comma.
    -   The `document_retagger` no longer removes inbox tags or tags
        without matching rules.
    -   The new configuration option `PAPERLESS_COOKIE_PREFIX` allows
        you to run multiple instances of paperless on different ports.
        This option enables you to be logged in into multiple instances
        by specifying different cookie names for each instance.
-   Fixes
    -   Sometimes paperless would assign dates in the future to newly
        consumed documents.
    -   The filename format fields `{created_month}` and `{created_day}`
        now use a leading zero for single digit values.
    -   The filename format field `{tags}` can no longer be used without
        arguments.
    -   Paperless was not able to consume many images (especially images
        from mobile scanners) due to missing DPI information. Paperless
        now assumes A4 paper size for PDF generation if no DPI
        information is present.
    -   Documents with empty titles could not be opened from the table
        view due to the link being empty.
    -   Fixed an issue with filenames containing special characters such
        as `:` not being accepted for upload.
    -   Fixed issues with thumbnail generation for plain text files.

### paperless-ng 0.9.6

This release focusses primarily on many small issues with the UI.

-   Front end
    -   Paperless now has proper window titles.
    -   Fixed an issue with the small cards when more than 7 tags were
        used.
    -   Navigation of the "Show all" links adjusted. They navigate to
        the saved view now, if available in the sidebar.
    -   Some indication on the document lists that a filter is active
        was added.
    -   There's a new filter to filter for documents that do _not_ have
        a certain tag.
    -   The file upload box now shows upload progress.
    -   The document edit page was reorganized.
    -   The document edit page shows various information about a
        document.
    -   An issue with the height of the preview was fixed.
    -   Table issues with too long document titles fixed.
-   API
    -   The API now serves file names with documents.
    -   The API now serves various metadata about documents.
    -   API documentation updated.
-   Other
    -   Fixed an issue with the docker image when a non-standard
        PostgreSQL port was used.
    -   The docker image was trying check for installed languages before
        actually installing them.
    -   `FILENAME_FORMAT` placeholder for document types.
    -   The filename formatter is now less restrictive with file names
        and tries to conserve the original correspondents, types and
        titles as much as possible.
    -   The filename formatter does not include the document ID in
        filenames anymore. It will rather append `_01`, `_02`, etc when
        it detects duplicate filenames.

!!! note

The changes to the filename format will apply to newly added documents
and changed documents. If you want all files to reflect these changes,
execute the `document_renamer` management command.

### paperless-ng 0.9.5

This release concludes the big changes I wanted to get rolled into
paperless. The next releases before 1.0 will focus on fixing issues,
primarily.

-   OCR
    -   Paperless now uses
        [OCRmyPDF](https://github.com/jbarlow83/OCRmyPDF) to perform OCR
        on documents. It still uses tesseract under the hood, but the
        PDF parser of Paperless has changed considerably and will behave
        different for some documents.
    -   OCRmyPDF creates archived PDF/A documents with embedded text
        that can be selected in the front end.
    -   Paperless stores archived versions of documents alongside with
        the originals. The originals can be accessed on the document
        edit page. If available, a dropdown menu will appear next to the
        download button.
    -   Many of the configuration options regarding OCR have changed.
        See [OCR settings](configuration.md#ocr) for details.
    -   Paperless no longer guesses the language of your documents. It
        always uses the language that you specified with
        `PAPERLESS_OCR_LANGUAGE`. Be sure to set this to the language
        the majority of your documents are in. Multiple languages can be
        specified, but that requires more CPU time.
    -   The management command [`document_archiver`](administration.md#archiver)
        can be used to create archived versions for already existing documents.
-   Tags from consumption folder.
    -   Thanks to [jayme-github](https://github.com/jayme-github),
        paperless now consumes files from sub folders in the consumption
        folder and is able to assign tags based on the sub folders a
        document was found in. This can be configured with
        `PAPERLESS_CONSUMER_RECURSIVE` and
        `PAPERLESS_CONSUMER_SUBDIRS_AS_TAGS`.
-   API
    -   The API now offers token authentication.
    -   The endpoint for uploading documents now supports specifying
        custom titles, correspondents, tags and types. This can be used
        by clients to override the default behavior of paperless. See
        [POSTing documents](api.md#file-uploads).
    -   The document endpoint of API now serves documents in this form:
        -   correspondents, document types and tags are referenced by
            their ID in the fields `correspondent`, `document_type` and
            `tags`. The `*_id` versions are gone. These fields are
            read/write.
        -   paperless does not serve nested tags, correspondents or
            types anymore.
-   Front end
    -   Paperless does some basic caching of correspondents, tags and
        types and will only request them from the server when necessary
        or when entirely reloading the page.
    -   Document list fetching is about 10%-30% faster now, especially
        when lots of tags/correspondents are present.
    -   Some minor improvements to the front end, such as document count
        in the document list, better highlighting of the current page,
        and improvements to the filter behavior.
-   Fixes:
    -   A bug with the generation of filenames for files with
        unsupported types caused the exporter and document saving to
        crash.
    -   Mail handling no longer exits entirely when encountering errors.
        It will skip the account/rule/message on which the error
        occurred.
    -   Assigning correspondents from mail sender names failed for very
        long names. Paperless no longer assigns correspondents in these
        cases.

### paperless-ng 0.9.4

-   Searching:
    -   Paperless now supports searching by tags, types and dates and
        correspondents. In order to have this applied to your existing
        documents, you need to perform a `document_index reindex`
        management command (see [document search index](administration.md#index))
        that adds the data to the search index. You only need to do this
        once, since the schema of the search index changed. Paperless
        keeps the index updated after that whenever something changes.
    -   Paperless now has spelling corrections ("Did you mean") for
        miss-typed queries.
    -   The documentation contains
        [information about the query syntax](usage.md#basic-usage_searching).
-   Front end:
    -   Clickable tags, correspondents and types allow quick filtering
        for related documents.
    -   Saved views are now editable.
    -   Preview documents directly in the browser.
    -   Navigation from the dashboard to saved views.
-   Fixes:
    -   A severe error when trying to use post consume scripts.
    -   An error in the consumer that cause invalid messages of missing
        files to show up in the log.
-   The documentation now contains information about bare metal installs
    and a section about how to setup the development environment.

### paperless-ng 0.9.3

-   Setting `PAPERLESS_AUTO_LOGIN_USERNAME` replaces
    `PAPERLESS_DISABLE_LOGIN`. You have to specify your username.
-   Added a simple sanity checker that checks your documents for missing
    or orphaned files, files with wrong checksums, inaccessible files,
    and documents with empty content.
-   It is no longer possible to encrypt your documents. For the time
    being, paperless will continue to operate with already encrypted
    documents.
-   Fixes:
    -   Paperless now uses inotify again, since the watchdog was causing
        issues which I was not aware of.
    -   Issue with the automatic classifier not working with only one
        tag.
    -   A couple issues with the search index being opened to eagerly.
-   Added lots of tests for various parts of the application.

### paperless-ng 0.9.2

-   Major changes to the front end (colors, logo, shadows, layout of the
    cards, better mobile support)
-   Paperless now uses mime types and libmagic detection to determine if
    a file type is supported and which parser to use. Removes all file
    type checks that where present in MANY different places in
    paperless.
-   Mail consumer now correctly consumes documents even when their
    content type was not set correctly. (i.e. PDF documents with content
    type `application/octet-stream`)
-   Basic sorting of mail rules added
-   Much better admin for mail rule editing.
-   Docker entrypoint script awaits the database server if it is
    configured.
-   Disabled editing of logs.
-   New setting `PAPERLESS_OCR_PAGES` limits the tesseract parser to the
    first n pages of scanned documents.
-   Fixed a bug where tasks with too long task names would not show up
    in the admin.

### paperless-ng 0.9.1

-   Moved documentation of the settings to the actual documentation.
-   Updated release script to force the user to choose between SQLite
    and PostgreSQL. This avoids confusion when upgrading from paperless.

### paperless-ng 0.9.0

-   **Deprecated:** GnuPG. [See this note on the state of GnuPG in paperless-ng.](administration.md#encryption)
    This features will most likely be removed in future versions.
-   **Added:** New frontend. Features:
    -   Single page application: It's much more responsive than the
        django admin pages.
    -   Dashboard. Shows recently scanned documents, or todo notes, or
        other documents at wish. Allows uploading of documents. Shows
        basic statistics.
    -   Better document list with multiple display options.
    -   Full text search with result highlighting, auto completion and
        scoring based on the query. It uses a document search index in
        the background.
    -   Saveable filters.
    -   Better log viewer.
-   **Added:** Document types. Assign these to documents just as
    correspondents. They may be used in the future to perform automatic
    operations on documents depending on the type.
-   **Added:** Inbox tags. Define an inbox tag and it will automatically
    be assigned to any new document scanned into the system.
-   **Added:** Automatic matching. A new matching algorithm that
    automatically assigns tags, document types and correspondents to
    your documents. It uses a neural network trained on your data.
-   **Added:** Archive serial numbers. Assign these to quickly find
    documents stored in physical binders.
-   **Added:** Enabled the internal user management of django. This
    isn't really a multi user solution, however, it allows more than
    one user to access the website and set some basic permissions /
    renew passwords.
-   **Modified \[breaking\]:** All new mail consumer with customizable
    filters, actions and multiple account support. Replaces the old mail
    consumer. The new mail consumer needs different configuration but
    can be configured to act exactly like the old consumer.
-   **Modified:** Changes to the consumer:
    -   Now uses the excellent watchdog library that should make sure
        files are discovered no matter what the platform is.
    -   The consumer now uses a task scheduler to run consumption
        processes in parallel. This means that consuming many documents
        should be much faster on systems with many cores.
    -   Concurrency is controlled with the new settings
        `PAPERLESS_TASK_WORKERS` and `PAPERLESS_THREADS_PER_WORKER`. See
        TODO for details on concurrency.
    -   The consumer no longer blocks the database for extended periods
        of time.
    -   An issue with tesseract running multiple threads per page and
        slowing down the consumer was fixed.
-   **Modified \[breaking\]:** REST Api changes:
    -   New filters added, other filters removed (case sensitive
        filters, slug filters)
    -   Endpoints for thumbnails, previews and downloads replace the old
        `/fetch/` urls. Redirects are in place.
    -   Endpoint for document uploads replaces the old `/push` url.
        Redirects are in place.
    -   Foreign key relationships are now served as IDs, not as urls.
-   **Modified \[breaking\]:** PostgreSQL:
    -   If `PAPERLESS_DBHOST` is specified in the settings, paperless
        uses PostgreSQL instead of SQLite. Username, database and
        password all default to `paperless` if not specified.
-   **Modified \[breaking\]:** document_retagger management command
    rework. See [Document retagger](administration.md#retagger) for
    details. Replaces `document_correspondents` management command.
-   **Removed \[breaking\]:** Reminders.
-   **Removed:** All customizations made to the django admin pages.
-   **Removed \[breaking\]:** The docker image no longer supports SSL.
    If you want to expose paperless to the internet, hide paperless
    behind a proxy server that handles SSL requests.
-   **Internal changes:** Mostly code cleanup, including:
    -   Rework of the code of the tesseract parser. This is now a lot
        cleaner.
    -   Rework of the filename handling code. It was a mess.
    -   Fixed some issues with the document exporter not exporting all
        documents when encountering duplicate filenames.
    -   Added a task scheduler that takes care of checking mail,
        training the classifier, maintaining the document search index
        and consuming documents.
    -   Updated dependencies. Now uses Pipenv all around.
    -   Updated Dockerfile and docker-compose. Now uses `supervisord` to
        run everything paperless-related in a single container.
-   **Settings:**
    -   `PAPERLESS_FORGIVING_OCR` is now default and gone. Reason: Even
        if `langdetect` fails to detect a language, tesseract still does
        a very good job at ocr'ing a document with the default
        language. Certain language specifics such as umlauts may not get
        picked up properly.
    -   `PAPERLESS_DEBUG` defaults to `false`.
    -   The presence of `PAPERLESS_DBHOST` now determines whether to use
        PostgreSQL or SQLite.
    -   `PAPERLESS_OCR_THREADS` is gone and replaced with
        `PAPERLESS_TASK_WORKERS` and `PAPERLESS_THREADS_PER_WORKER`.
        Refer to the config example for details.
    -   `PAPERLESS_OPTIMIZE_THUMBNAILS` allows you to disable or enable
        thumbnail optimization. This is useful on less powerful devices.
-   Many more small changes here and there. The usual stuff.

## Paperless

### 2.7.0

-   [syntonym](https://github.com/syntonym) submitted a pull request to
    catch IMAP connection errors
    [#475](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/475).
-   [Stéphane Brunner](https://github.com/sbrunner) added `psycopg2` to
    the Pipfile
    [#489](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/489).
    He also fixed a syntax error in `docker-compose.yml.example`
    [#488](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/488)
    and added [DjangoQL](https://github.com/ivelum/djangoql), which
    allows a litany of handy search functionality
    [#492](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/492).
-   [CkuT](https://github.com/CkuT) and
    [JOKer](https://github.com/MasterofJOKers) hacked out a simple, but
    super-helpful optimisation to how the thumbnails are served up,
    improving performance considerably
    [#481](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/481).
-   [tsia](https://github.com/tsia) added a few fields to the tags REST
    API.
    [#483](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/483).
-   [Brian Cribbs](https://github.com/cribbstechnolog) improved the
    documentation to help people using Paperless over NFS
    [#484](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/484).
-   [Brendan M. Sleight](https://github.com/bmsleight) updated the
    documentation to include a note for setting the `DEBUG` value. The
    `paperless.conf.example` file was also updated to mirror the project
    defaults.

### 2.6.1

-   We now have a logo, complete with a favicon :-)
-   Removed some problematic tests.
-   Fix the docker-compose example config to include a shared consume
    volume so that using the push API will work for users of the Docker
    install. Thanks to [Colin Frei](https://github.com/colinfrei) for
    fixing this in
    [#466](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/466).
-   [khrise](https://github.com/khrise) submitted a pull request to
    include the `added` property to the REST API
    [#471](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/471).

### 2.6.0

-   Allow an infinite number of logs to be deleted. Thanks to
    [Ulli](https://github.com/Ulli2k) for noting the problem in
    [#433](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/433).
-   Fix the `RecentCorrespondentsFilter` correspondents filter that was
    added in 2.4 to play nice with the defaults. Thanks to
    [tsia](https://github.com/tsia) and
    [Sblop](https://github.com/Sblop) who pointed this out.
    [#423](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/423).
-   Updated dependencies to include (among other things) a security
    patch to requests.
-   Fix text in sample data for tests so that the language guesser stops
    thinking that everything is in Catalan because we had _Lorem ipsum_
    in there.
-   Tweaked the gunicorn sample command to use filesystem paths instead
    of Python paths.
    [#441](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/441)
-   Added pretty colour boxes next to the hex values in the Tags
    section, thanks to a pull request from [Joshua
    Taillon](https://github.com/jat255)
    [#442](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/442).
-   Added a `.editorconfig` file to better specify coding style.
-   [Joshua Taillon](https://github.com/jat255) also added some logic to
    tie Paperless' date guessing logic into how it parses file names on
    import.
    [#440](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/440)

### 2.5.0

-   **New dependency**: Paperless now optimises thumbnail generation
    with [optipng](https://optipng.sourceforge.net/), so you'll need to
    install that somewhere in your PATH or declare its location in
    `PAPERLESS_OPTIPNG_BINARY`. The Docker image has already been
    updated on the Docker Hub, so you just need to pull the latest one
    from there if you're a Docker user.
-   "Login free" instances of Paperless were breaking whenever you
    tried to edit objects in the admin: adding/deleting tags or
    correspondents, or even fixing spelling. This was due to the "user
    hack" we were applying to sessions that weren't using a login, as
    that hack user didn't have a valid id. The fix was to attribute the
    first user id in the system to this hack user.
    [#394](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/394)
-   A problem in how we handle slug values on Tags and Correspondents
    required a few changes to how we handle this field
    [#393](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/393):
    1.  Slugs are no longer editable. They're derived from the name of
        the tag or correspondent at save time, so if you wanna change
        the slug, you have to change the name, and even then you're
        restricted to the rules of the `slugify()` function. The slug
        value is still visible in the admin though.
    2.  I've added a migration to go over all existing tags &
        correspondents and rewrite the `.slug` values to ones conforming
        to the `slugify()` rules.
    3.  The consumption process now uses the same rules as `.save()` in
        determining a slug and using that to check for an existing
        tag/correspondent.
-   An annoying bug in the date capture code was causing some bogus
    dates to be attached to documents, which in turn busted the UI.
    Thanks to [Andrew Peng](https://github.com/pengc99) for reporting
    this.
    [#414](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/414).
-   A bug in the Dockerfile meant that Tesseract language files weren't
    being installed correctly. [euri10](https://github.com/euri10) was
    quick to provide a fix:
    [#406](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/406),
    [#413](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/413).
-   Document consumption is now wrapped in a transaction as per an old
    ticket
    [#262](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/262).
-   The `get_date()` functionality of the parsers has been consolidated
    onto the `DocumentParser` class since much of that code was
    redundant anyway.

### 2.4.0

-   A new set of actions are now available thanks to
    [jonaswinkler](https://github.com/jonaswinkler)'s very first pull
    request! You can now do nifty things like tag documents in bulk, or
    set correspondents in bulk.
    [#405](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/405)
-   The import/export system is now a little smarter. By default,
    documents are tagged as `unencrypted`, since exports are by their
    nature unencrypted. It's now in the import step that we decide the
    storage type. This allows you to export from an encrypted system and
    import into an unencrypted one, or vice-versa.
-   The migration history has been slightly modified to accommodate
    PostgreSQL users. Additionally, you can now tell paperless to use
    PostgreSQL simply by declaring `PAPERLESS_DBUSER` in your
    environment. This will attempt to connect to your Postgres database
    without a password unless you also set `PAPERLESS_DBPASS`.
-   A bug was found in the REST API filter system that was the result of
    an update of django-filter some time ago. This has now been patched
    in
    [#412](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/412).
    Thanks to [thepill](https://github.com/thepill) for spotting it!

### 2.3.0

-   Support for consuming plain text & markdown documents was added by
    [Joshua Taillon](https://github.com/jat255)! This was a
    long-requested feature, and it's addition is likely to be greatly
    appreciated by the community:
    [#395](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/395)
    Thanks also to [David Martin](https://github.com/ddddavidmartin) for
    his assistance on the issue.
-   [dubit0](https://github.com/dubit0) found & fixed a bug that
    prevented management commands from running before we had an
    operational database:
    [#396](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/396)
-   Joshua also added a simple update to the thumbnail generation
    process to improve performance:
    [#399](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/399)
-   As his last bit of effort on this release, Joshua also added some
    code to allow you to view the documents inline rather than download
    them as an attachment.
    [#400](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/400)
-   Finally, [ahyear](https://github.com/ahyear) found a slip in the
    Docker documentation and patched it.
    [#401](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/401)

### 2.2.1

-   [Kyle Lucy](https://github.com/kmlucy) reported a bug quickly after
    the release of 2.2.0 where we broke the `DISABLE_LOGIN` feature:
    [#392](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/392).

### 2.2.0

-   Thanks to [dadosch](https://github.com/dadosch), [Wolfgang
    Mader](https://github.com/wmader), and [Tim
    Brooks](https://github.com/brookst) this is the first version of
    Paperless that supports Django 2.0! As a result of their hard work,
    you can now also run Paperless on Python 3.7 as well:
    [#386](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/386)
    &
    [#390](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/390).
-   [Stéphane Brunner](https://github.com/sbrunner) added a few lines of
    code that made tagging interface a lot easier on those of us with
    lots of different tags:
    [#391](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/391).
-   [Kilian Koeltzsch](https://github.com/kiliankoe) noticed a bug in
    how we capture & automatically create tags, so that's fixed now
    too:
    [#384](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/384).
-   [erikarvstedt](https://github.com/erikarvstedt) tweaked the
    behaviour of the test suite to be better behaved for packaging
    environments:
    [#383](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/383).
-   [Lukasz Soluch](https://github.com/LukaszSolo) added CORS support to
    make building a new Javascript-based front-end cleaner & easier:
    [#387](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/387).

### 2.1.0

-   [Enno Lohmeier](https://github.com/elohmeier) added three simple
    features that make Paperless a lot more user (and developer)
    friendly:
    1.  There's a new search box on the front page:
        [#374](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/374).
    2.  The correspondents & tags pages now have a column showing the
        number of relevant documents:
        [#375](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/375).
    3.  The Dockerfile has been tweaked to build faster for those of us
        who are doing active development on Paperless using the Docker
        environment:
        [#376](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/376).
-   You now also have the ability to customise the interface to your
    heart's content by creating a file called `overrides.css` and/or
    `overrides.js` in the root of your media directory. Thanks to [Mark
    McFate](https://github.com/SummittDweller) for this idea:
    [#371](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/371)

### 2.0.0

This is a big release as we've changed a core-functionality of
Paperless: we no longer encrypt files with GPG by default.

The reasons for this are many, but it boils down to that the encryption
wasn't really all that useful, as files on-disk were still accessible
so long as you had the key, and the key was most typically stored in the
config file. In other words, your files are only as safe as the
`paperless` user is. In addition to that, _the contents of the documents
were never encrypted_, so important numbers etc. were always accessible
simply by querying the database. Still, it was better than nothing, but
the consensus from users appears to be that it was more an annoyance
than anything else, so this feature is now turned off unless you
explicitly set a passphrase in your config file.

### Migrating from 1.x

Encryption isn't gone, it's just off for new users. So long as you
have `PAPERLESS_PASSPHRASE` set in your config or your environment,
Paperless should continue to operate as it always has. If however, you
want to drop encryption too, you only need to do two things:

1.  Run
    `./manage.py migrate && ./manage.py change_storage_type gpg unencrypted`.
    This will go through your entire database and Decrypt All The
    Things.
2.  Remove `PAPERLESS_PASSPHRASE` from your `paperless.conf` file, or
    simply stop declaring it in your environment.

Special thanks to [erikarvstedt](https://github.com/erikarvstedt),
[matthewmoto](https://github.com/matthewmoto), and
[mcronce](https://github.com/mcronce) who did the bulk of the work on
this big change.

### 1.4.0

-   [Quentin Dawans](https://github.com/ovv) has refactored the document
    consumer to allow for some command-line options. Notably, you can
    now direct it to consume from a particular `--directory`, limit the
    `--loop-time`, set the time between mail server checks with
    `--mail-delta` or just run it as a one-off with `--one-shot`. See
    [#305](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/305)
    &
    [#313](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/313)
    for more information.
-   Refactor the use of travis/tox/pytest/coverage into two files:
    `.travis.yml` and `setup.cfg`.
-   Start generating requirements.txt from a Pipfile. I'll probably
    switch over to just using pipenv in the future.
-   All for a alternative FreeBSD-friendly location for
    `paperless.conf`. Thanks to [Martin
    Arendtsen](https://github.com/Arendtsen) who provided this
    ([#322](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/322)).
-   Document consumption events are now logged in the Django admin
    events log. Thanks to [CkuT](https://github.com/CkuT) for doing the
    legwork on this one and to [Quentin Dawans](https://github.com/ovv)
    & [David Martin](https://github.com/ddddavidmartin) for helping to
    coordinate & work out how the feature would be developed.
-   [erikarvstedt](https://github.com/erikarvstedt) contributed a pull
    request
    ([#328](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/328))
    to add `--noreload` to the default server start process. This helps
    reduce the load imposed by the running webservice.
-   Through some discussion on
    [#253](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/253)
    and
    [#323](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/323),
    we've removed a few of the hardcoded URL values to make it easier
    for people to host Paperless on a subdirectory. Thanks to [Quentin
    Dawans](https://github.com/ovv) and [Kyle
    Lucy](https://github.com/kmlucy) for helping to work this out.
-   The clickable area for documents on the listing page has been
    increased to a more predictable space thanks to a glorious hack from
    [erikarvstedt](https://github.com/erikarvstedt) in
    [#344](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/344).
-   [Strubbl](https://github.com/strubbl) noticed an annoying bug in the
    bash script wrapping the Docker entrypoint and fixed it with some
    very creating Bash skills:
    [#352](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/352).
-   You can now use the search field to find documents by tag thanks to
    [thinkjk](https://github.com/thinkjk)'s _first ever issue_:
    [#354](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/354).
-   Inotify is now being used to detect additions to the consume
    directory thanks to some excellent work from
    [erikarvstedt](https://github.com/erikarvstedt) on
    [#351](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/351)

### 1.3.0

-   You can now run Paperless without a login, though you'll still have
    to create at least one user. This is thanks to a pull-request from
    [matthewmoto](https://github.com/matthewmoto):
    [#295](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/295).
    Note that logins are still required by default, and that you need to
    disable them by setting `PAPERLESS_DISABLE_LOGIN="true"` in your
    environment or in `/etc/paperless.conf`.
-   Fix for
    [#303](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/303)
    where sketchily-formatted documents could cause the consumer to
    break and insert half-records into the database breaking all sorts
    of things. We now capture the return codes of both `convert` and
    `unpaper` and fail-out nicely.
-   Fix for additional date types thanks to input from
    [Isaac](https://github.com/isaacsando) and code from
    [BastianPoe](https://github.com/BastianPoe)
    ([#301](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/301)).
-   Fix for running migrations in the Docker container
    ([#299](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/299)).
    Thanks to [Georgi Todorov](https://github.com/TeraHz) for the fix
    ([#300](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/300))
    and to [Pit](https://github.com/pitkley) for the review.
-   Fix for Docker cases where the issuing user is not UID 1000. This
    was a collaborative fix between [Jeffrey
    Portman](https://github.com/ChromoX) and
    [Pit](https://github.com/pitkley) in
    [#311](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/311)
    and
    [#312](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/312)
    to fix
    [#306](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/306).
-   Patch the historical migrations to support MySQL's um,
    _interesting_ way of handing indexes
    ([#308](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/308)).
    Thanks to [Simon Taddiken](https://github.com/skuzzle) for reporting
    the problem and helping me find where to fix it.

### 1.2.0

-   New Docker image, now based on Alpine, thanks to the efforts of
    [addadi](https://github.com/addadi) and
    [Pit](https://github.com/pitkley). This new image is dramatically
    smaller than the Debian-based one, and it also has [a new home on
    Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/danielquinn/paperless/). A
    proper thank-you to [Pit](https://github.com/pitkley) for hosting
    the image on his Docker account all this time, but after some
    discussion, we decided the image needed a more _official-looking_
    home.
-   [BastianPoe](https://github.com/BastianPoe) has added the
    long-awaited feature to automatically skip the OCR step when the PDF
    already contains text. This can be overridden by setting
    `PAPERLESS_OCR_ALWAYS=YES` either in your `paperless.conf` or in the
    environment. Note that this also means that Paperless now requires
    `libpoppler-cpp-dev` to be installed. **Important**: You'll need to
    run `pip install -r requirements.txt` after the usual `git pull` to
    properly update.
-   [BastianPoe](https://github.com/BastianPoe) has also contributed a
    monumental amount of work
    ([#291](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/291))
    to solving
    [#158](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/158):
    setting the document creation date based on finding a date in the
    document text.

### 1.1.0

-   Fix for
    [#283](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/283),
    a redirect bug which broke interactions with paperless-desktop.
    Thanks to [chris-aeviator](https://github.com/chris-aeviator) for
    reporting it.
-   Addition of an optional new financial year filter, courtesy of
    [David Martin](https://github.com/ddddavidmartin)
    [#256](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/256)
-   Fixed a typo in how thumbnails were named in exports
    [#285](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/285),
    courtesy of [Dan Panzarella](https://github.com/pzl)

### 1.0.0

-   Upgrade to Django 1.11. **You'll need to run \`\`pip install -r
    requirements.txt\`\` after the usual \`\`git pull\`\` to properly
    update**.
-   Replace the templatetag-based hack we had for document listing in
    favour of a slightly less ugly solution in the form of another
    template tag with less copypasta.
-   Support for multi-word-matches for auto-tagging thanks to an
    excellent patch from [ishirav](https://github.com/ishirav)
    [#277](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/277).
-   Fixed a CSS bug reported by [Stefan Hagen](https://github.com/xkpd3)
    that caused an overlapping of the text and checkboxes under some
    resolutions
    [#272](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/272).
-   Patched the Docker config to force the serving of static files.
    Credit for this one goes to [dev-rke](https://github.com/dev-rke)
    via
    [#248](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/248).
-   Fix file permissions during Docker start up thanks to
    [Pit](https://github.com/pitkley) on
    [#268](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/268).
-   Date fields in the admin are now expressed as HTML5 date fields
    thanks to [Lukas Winkler](https://github.com/Findus23)'s issue
    [#278](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/248)

### 0.8.0

-   Paperless can now run in a subdirectory on a host (`/paperless`),
    rather than always running in the root (`/`) thanks to
    [maphy-psd](https://github.com/maphy-psd)'s work on
    [#255](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/255).

### 0.7.0

-   **Potentially breaking change**: As per
    [#235](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/235),
    Paperless will no longer automatically delete documents attached to
    correspondents when those correspondents are themselves deleted.
    This was Django's default behaviour, but didn't make much sense in
    Paperless' case. Thanks to [Thomas
    Brueggemann](https://github.com/thomasbrueggemann) and [David
    Martin](https://github.com/ddddavidmartin) for their input on this
    one.
-   Fix for
    [#232](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/232)
    wherein Paperless wasn't recognising `.tif` files properly. Thanks
    to [ayounggun](https://github.com/ayounggun) for reporting this one
    and to [Kusti Skytén](https://github.com/kskyten) for posting the
    correct solution in the GitHub issue.

### 0.6.0

-   Abandon the shared-secret trick we were using for the POST API in
    favour of BasicAuth or Django session.
-   Fix the POST API so it actually works.
    [#236](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/236)
-   **Breaking change**: We've dropped the use of
    `PAPERLESS_SHARED_SECRET` as it was being used both for the API (now
    replaced with a normal auth) and form email polling. Now that we're
    only using it for email, this variable has been renamed to
    `PAPERLESS_EMAIL_SECRET`. The old value will still work for a while,
    but you should change your config if you've been using the email
    polling feature. Thanks to [Joshua
    Gilman](https://github.com/jmgilman) for all the help with this
    feature.

### 0.5.0

-   Support for fuzzy matching in the auto-tagger & auto-correspondent
    systems thanks to [Jake Gysland](https://github.com/jgysland)'s
    patch
    [#220](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/220).
-   Modified the Dockerfile to prepare an export directory
    ([#212](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/212)).
    Thanks to combined efforts from [Pit](https://github.com/pitkley)
    and [Strubbl](https://github.com/strubbl) in working out the kinks
    on this one.
-   Updated the import/export scripts to include support for thumbnails.
    Big thanks to [CkuT](https://github.com/CkuT) for finding this
    shortcoming and doing the work to get it fixed in
    [#224](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/224).
-   All of the following changes are thanks to [David
    Martin](https://github.com/ddddavidmartin): \* Bumped the dependency on pyocr to 0.4.7 so new users can make use
    of Tesseract 4 if they so prefer
    ([#226](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/226)).
    -   Fixed a number of issues with the automated mail handler
        ([#227](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/227),
        [#228](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/228))
    -   Amended the documentation for better handling of systemd service
        files
        ([#229](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/229))
    -   Amended the Django Admin configuration to have nice headers
        ([#230](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/230))

### 0.4.1

-   Fix for
    [#206](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/206)
    wherein the pluggable parser didn't recognise files with all-caps
    suffixes like `.PDF`

### 0.4.0

-   Introducing reminders. See
    [#199](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/199)
    for more information, but the short explanation is that you can now
    attach simple notes & times to documents which are made available
    via the API. Currently, the default API (basically just the Django
    admin) doesn't really make use of this, but [Thomas
    Brueggemann](https://github.com/thomasbrueggemann) over at
    [Paperless
    Desktop](https://github.com/thomasbrueggemann/paperless-desktop) has
    said that he would like to make use of this feature in his project.

### 0.3.6

-   Fix for
    [#200](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/200)
    (!!) where the API wasn't configured to allow updating the
    correspondent or the tags for a document.
-   The `content` field is now optional, to allow for the edge case of a
    purely graphical document.
-   You can no longer add documents via the admin. This never worked in
    the first place, so all I've done here is remove the link to the
    broken form.
-   The consumer code has been heavily refactored to support a pluggable
    interface. Install a paperless consumer via pip and tell paperless
    about it with an environment variable, and you're good to go.
    Proper documentation is on its way.

### 0.3.5

-   A serious facelift for the documents listing page wherein we drop
    the tabular layout in favour of a tiled interface.
-   Users can now configure the number of items per page.
-   Fix for
    [#171](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/171):
    Allow users to specify their own `SECRET_KEY` value.
-   Moved the dotenv loading to the top of settings.py
-   Fix for
    [#112](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/112):
    Added checks for binaries required for document consumption.

### 0.3.4

-   Removal of django-suit due to a licensing conflict I bumped into in
    0.3.3. Note that you _can_ use Django Suit with Paperless, but only
    in a non-profit situation as their free license prohibits for-profit
    use. As a result, I can't bundle Suit with Paperless without
    conflicting with the GPL. Further development will be done against
    the stock Django admin.
-   I shrunk the thumbnails a little 'cause they were too big for me,
    even on my high-DPI monitor.
-   BasicAuth support for document and thumbnail downloads, as well as
    the Push API thanks to \@thomasbrueggemann. See
    [#179](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/179).

### 0.3.3

-   Thumbnails in the UI and a Django-suit -based face-lift courtesy of
    \@ekw!
-   Timezone, items per page, and default language are now all
    configurable, also thanks to \@ekw.

### 0.3.2

-   Fix for
    [#172](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/172):
    defaulting ALLOWED_HOSTS to `["*"]` and allowing the user to set
    her own value via `PAPERLESS_ALLOWED_HOSTS` should the need arise.

### 0.3.1

-   Added a default value for `CONVERT_BINARY`

### 0.3.0

-   Updated to using django-filter 1.x
-   Added some system checks so new users aren't confused by
    misconfigurations.
-   Consumer loop time is now configurable for systems with slow writes.
    Just set `PAPERLESS_CONSUMER_LOOP_TIME` to a number of seconds. The
    default is 10.
-   As per
    [#44](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/44),
    we've removed support for `PAPERLESS_CONVERT`, `PAPERLESS_CONSUME`,
    and `PAPERLESS_SECRET`. Please use `PAPERLESS_CONVERT_BINARY`,
    `PAPERLESS_CONSUMPTION_DIR`, and `PAPERLESS_SHARED_SECRET`
    respectively instead.

### 0.2.0

-   [#150](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/150):
    The media root is now a variable you can set in `paperless.conf`.
-   [#148](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/pull/148):
    The database location (sqlite) is now a variable you can set in
    `paperless.conf`.
-   [#146](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/146):
    Fixed a bug that allowed unauthorised access to the `/fetch` URL.
-   [#131](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/131):
    Document files are now automatically removed from disk when they're
    deleted in Paperless.
-   [#121](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/121):
    Fixed a bug where Paperless wasn't setting document creation time
    based on the file naming scheme.
-   [#81](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/81):
    Added a hook to run an arbitrary script after every document is
    consumed.
-   [#98](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/98):
    Added optional environment variables for ImageMagick so that it
    doesn't explode when handling Very Large Documents or when it's
    just running on a low-memory system. Thanks to [Florian
    Harr](https://github.com/evils) for his help on this one.
-   [#89](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/89)
    Ported the auto-tagging code to correspondents as well. Thanks to
    [Justin Snyman](https://github.com/stringlytyped) for the pointers
    in the issue queue.
-   Added support for guessing the date from the file name along with
    the correspondent, title, and tags. Thanks to [Tikitu de
    Jager](https://github.com/tikitu) for his pull request that I took
    forever to merge and to [Pit](https://github.com/pitkley) for his
    efforts on the regex front.
-   [#94](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/94):
    Restored support for changing the created date in the UI. Thanks to
    [Martin Honermeyer](https://github.com/djmaze) and [Tim
    White](https://github.com/timwhite) for working with me on this.

### 0.1.1

-   Potentially **Breaking Change**: All references to "sender" in the
    code have been renamed to "correspondent" to better reflect the
    nature of the property (one could quite reasonably scan a document
    before sending it to someone.)
-   [#67](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/67):
    Rewrote the document exporter and added a new importer that allows
    for full metadata retention without depending on the file name and
    modification time. A big thanks to [Tikitu de
    Jager](https://github.com/tikitu),
    [Pit](https://github.com/pitkley), [Florian
    Jung](https://github.com/the01), and [Christopher
    Luu](https://github.com/nuudles) for their code snippets and
    contributing conversation that lead to this change.
-   [#20](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/20):
    Added _unpaper_ support to help in cleaning up the scanned image
    before it's OCR'd. Thanks to [Pit](https://github.com/pitkley) for
    this one.
-   [#71](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/71)
    Added (encrypted) thumbnails in anticipation of a proper UI.
-   [#68](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/68):
    Added support for using a proper config file at
    `/etc/paperless.conf` and modified the systemd unit files to use it.
-   Refactored the Vagrant installation process to use environment
    variables rather than asking the user to modify `settings.py`.
-   [#44](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/44):
    Harmonise environment variable names with constant names.
-   [#60](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/60):
    Setup logging to actually use the Python native logging framework.
-   [#53](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/53):
    Fixed an annoying bug that caused `.jpeg` and `.JPG` images to be
    imported but made unavailable.

### 0.1.0

-   Docker support! Big thanks to [Wayne
    Werner](https://github.com/waynew), [Brian
    Conn](https://github.com/TheConnMan), and [Tikitu de
    Jager](https://github.com/tikitu) for this one, and especially to
    [Pit](https://github.com/pitkley) who spearheadded this effort.
-   A simple REST API is in place, but it should be considered unstable.
-   Cleaned up the consumer to use temporary directories instead of a
    single scratch space. (Thanks [Pit](https://github.com/pitkley))
-   Improved the efficiency of the consumer by parsing pages more
    intelligently and introducing a threaded OCR process (thanks again
    [Pit](https://github.com/pitkley)).
-   [#45](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/45):
    Cleaned up the logic for tag matching. Reported by
    [darkmatter](https://github.com/darkmatter).
-   [#47](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/47):
    Auto-rotate landscape documents. Reported by
    [Paul](https://github.com/polo2ro) and fixed by
    [Pit](https://github.com/pitkley).
-   [#48](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/48):
    Matching algorithms should do so on a word boundary
    ([darkmatter](https://github.com/darkmatter))
-   [#54](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/54):
    Documented the re-tagger ([zedster](https://github.com/zedster))
-   [#57](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless/issues/57):
    Make sure file is preserved on import failure
    ([darkmatter](https://github.com/darkmatter))
-   Added tox with pep8 checking

### 0.0.6

-   Added support for parallel OCR (significant work from
    [Pit](https://github.com/pitkley))
-   Sped up the language detection (significant work from
    [Pit](https://github.com/pitkley))
-   Added simple logging

### 0.0.5

-   Added support for image files as documents (png, jpg, gif, tiff)
-   Added a crude means of HTTP POST for document imports
-   Added IMAP mail support
-   Added a re-tagging utility
-   Documentation for the above as well as data migration

### 0.0.4
