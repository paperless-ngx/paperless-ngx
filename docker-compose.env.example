# Environment variables to set for Paperless
# Commented out variables will be replaced with a default within Paperless.
#
# In addition to what you see here, you can also define any values you find in
# paperless.conf.example here.  Values like:
#
# * PAPERLESS_PASSPHRASE
# * PAPERLESS_CONSUMPTION_DIR
# * PAPERLESS_CONSUME_MAIL_HOST
#
# ...are all explained in that file but can be defined here, since the Docker
# installation doesn't make use of paperless.conf.


# Additional languages to install for text recognition.  Note that this is
# different from PAPERLESS_OCR_LANGUAGE (default=eng), which defines the
# default language used when guessing the language from the OCR output.
# PAPERLESS_OCR_LANGUAGES=deu ita

# Set Paperless to use SSL for the web interface.
# Enabling this will require ssl.key and ssl.cert files in paperless' data directory.
# PAPERLESS_USE_SSL=false

# You can change the default user and group id to a custom one
# USERMAP_UID=1000
# USERMAP_GID=1000
