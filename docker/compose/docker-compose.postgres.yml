# Docker Compose file for running edoc from the Docker Hub.
# This file contains everything edoc needs to run.
# Paperless supports amd64, arm and arm64 hardware.
#
# All compose files of edoc configure edoc in the following way:
#
# - Paperless is (re)started on system boot, if it was running before shutdown.
# - Docker volumes for storing data are managed by Docker.
# - Folders for importing and exporting files are created in the same directory
#   as this file and mounted to the correct folders inside the container.
# - Paperless listens on port 8000.
#
# In addition to that, this Docker Compose file adds the following optional
# configurations:
#
# - Instead of SQLite (default), PostgreSQL is used as the database server.
#
# To install and update edoc with this file, do the following:
#
# - Copy this file as 'docker-compose.yml' and the files 'docker-compose.env'
#   and '.env' into a folder.
# - Run 'docker compose pull'.
# - Run 'docker compose run --rm webserver createsuperuser' to create a user.
# - Run 'docker compose up -d'.
#
# For more extensive installation and update instructions, refer to the
# documentation.
