# Docker Compose file for running paperless from the Docker Hub.
# This file contains everything paperless needs to run.
# Paperless supports amd64, arm and arm64 hardware.
#
# All compose files of paperless configure paperless in the following way:
#
# - Paperless is (re)started on system boot, if it was running before shutdown.
# - Docker volumes for storing data are managed by Docker.
# - Folders for importing and exporting files are created in the same directory
#   as this file and mounted to the correct folders inside the container.
# - Paperless listens on port 8010.
#
# In addition to that, this Docker Compose file adds the following optional
# configurations:
#
# - Instead of SQLite (default), PostgreSQL is used as the database server.
#
# To install and update paperless with this file, do the following:
#
# - Open portainer Stacks list and click 'Add stack'
# - Paste the contents of this file and assign a name, e.g. 'paperless'
# - Upload 'docker-compose.env' by clicking on 'Load variables from .env file'
# - Modify the environment variables as needed
# - Click 'Deploy the stack' and wait for it to be deployed
# - Open the list of containers, select paperless_webserver_1
# - Click 'Console' and then 'Connect' to open the command line inside the container
# - Run 'python3 manage.py createsuperuser' to create a user
# - Exit the console
#
# For more extensive installation and update instructions, refer to the
# documentation.
