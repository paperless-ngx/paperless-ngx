The document exporter exports all your documents,     thumbnails, metadata, and database contents to a specific folder. You may import your     documents and settings into a fresh instance of paperless again or store your     documents in another DMS with this export.</p> <p>The document exporter is also able to update an already existing export.

In other words, if you define a tag called <code>Home Utility</code> that had a <code>match</code> property of <code>bc hydro</code> and a <code>matching_algorithm</code> of <code>Exact</code>, Paperless will automatically tag your newly-consumed document with your <code>Home Utility</code> tag so long as the text <code>bc hydro</code> appears in the body of the document somewhere.</p> <p>The matching logic is quite powerful. It supports searching the text of your document with different algorithms, and as such, some experimentation may be necessary to get things right.</p> <p>In order to have a tag, correspondent, document type, or storage path assigned automatically to newly consumed documents, assign a match and matching algorithm using the web interface. These settings define when to assign tags, correspondents, document types, and storage paths to documents.</p> <p>The following algorithms are available:</p> <ul> <li>None: No matching will be performed.</li> <li>Any: Looks for any occurrence of any word provided in match in     the PDF. If you define the match as <code>Bank1 Bank2</code>, it will match     documents containing either of these terms.</li> <li>All: Requires that every word provided appears in the PDF,     albeit not in the order provided.</li> <li>Exact: Matches only if the match appears exactly as provided     (i.e. preserve ordering) in the PDF.</li> <li>Regular expression: Parses the match as a regular expression and     tries to find a match within the document.</li> <li>Fuzzy match: Uses a partial matching based on locating the tag text     inside the document, using a partial ratio</li> <li>Auto: Tries to automatically match new documents. This does not     require you to set a match. See the notes below.</li> </ul> <p>When using the any or all matching algorithms, you can search for terms that consist of multiple words by enclosing them in double quotes. For example, defining a match text of <code>\"Bank of America\" BofA</code> using the any algorithm, will match documents that contain either \"Bank of America\" or \"BofA\", but will not match documents containing \"Bank of South America\".</p> <p>Then just save your tag, correspondent, document type, or storage path and run another document through the consumer. Once complete, you should see the newly-created document, automatically tagged with the appropriate data.</p>"},{"location":"advanced_usage/#automatic-matching","title":"Automatic matching","text":"<p>Paperless-ngx comes with a new matching algorithm called Auto. This matching algorithm tries to assign tags, correspondents, document types, and storage paths to your documents based on how you have already assigned these on existing documents. It uses a neural network under the hood.</p> <p>If, for example, all your bank statements of your account 123 at the Bank of America are tagged with the tag \"bofa123\" and the matching algorithm of this tag is set to Auto, this neural network will examine your documents and automatically learn when to assign this tag.</p> <p>Paperless tries to hide much of the involved complexity with this approach. However, there are a couple caveats you need to keep in mind when using this feature:</p> <ul> <li>Changes to your documents are not immediately reflected by the     matching algorithm. The neural network needs to be trained on your     documents after changes. Paperless periodically (default: once each     hour) checks for changes and does this automatically for you.</li> <li>The Auto matching algorithm only takes documents into account which     are NOT placed in your inbox (i.e. have any inbox tags assigned to     them). This ensures that the neural network only learns from     documents which you have correctly tagged before.</li> <li>The matching algorithm can only work if there is a correlation     between the tag, correspondent, document type, or storage path and     the document itself. Your bank statements usually contain your bank     account number and the name of the bank, so this works reasonably     well, However, tags such as \"TODO\" cannot be automatically     assigned.</li> <li>The matching algorithm needs a reasonable number of documents to     identify when to assign tags, correspondents, storage paths, and     types. If one out of a thousand documents has the correspondent     \"Very obscure web shop I bought something five years ago\", it will     probably not assign this correspondent automatically if you buy     something from them again. The more documents, the better.</li> <li>Paperless also needs a reasonable amount of negative examples to     decide when not to assign a certain tag, correspondent, document     type, or storage path. This will usually be the case as you start     filling up paperless with documents. Example: If all your documents     are either from \"Webshop\" or \"Bank\", paperless will assign one     of these correspondents to ANY new document, if both are set to     automatic matching.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"advanced_usage/#consume-hooks","title":"Hooking into the consumption process","text":"<p>Sometimes you may want to do something arbitrary whenever a document is consumed.

Once this scan is copied into the sub-directory, Paperless will collate the previous scan with the new one, reversing the order of the pages on the second, \"even numbered\" scan. The resulting document will have the pages 1-6 in the correct order, and this new file will then be processed as normal.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>When scanning the even numbered pages, you can omit the last empty pages, if there are any.

To avoid collating the wrong documents if you then come back a day later to scan a new double-sided document, Paperless will only keep an \"odd numbered pages\" file for up to 30 minutes.

In order to do that, you need to write the parser itself and announce its existence to Paperless-ngx.</p> <p>The parser itself must extend <code>documents.parsers.DocumentParser</code> and must implement the methods <code>parse</code> and <code>get_thumbnail</code>. You can provide your own implementation to <code>get_date</code> if you don't want to rely on Paperless-ngx' default date guessing mechanisms.</p> <pre><code>class MyCustomParser(DocumentParser):\n\n    def parse(self, document_path, mime_type):\n        # This method does not return anything. Rather, you should assign\n        # whatever you got from the document to the following fields:\n\n        # The content of the document.\n        self.text = \"content\"\n\n        # Optional: path to a PDF document that you created from the original.\n        self.archive_path = os.path.join(self.tempdir, \"archived.pdf\")\n\n        # Optional: \"created\" date of the document.\n        self.date = get_created_from_metadata(document_path)\n\n    def get_thumbnail(self, document_path, mime_type):\n        # This should return the path to a thumbnail you created for this\n        # document.\n        return os.path.join(self.tempdir, \"thumb.webp\")\n</code></pre> <p>If you encounter any issues during parsing, raise a <code>documents.parsers.ParseError</code>.</p> <p>The <code>self.tempdir</code> directory is a temporary directory that is guaranteed to be empty and removed after consumption finished. You can use that directory to store any intermediate files and also use it to store the thumbnail / archived document.</p> <p>After that, you need to announce your parser to Paperless-ngx. You need to connect a handler to the <code>document_consumer_declaration</code> signal. Have a look in the file <code>src/paperless_tesseract/apps.py</code> on how that's done. The handler is a method that returns information about your parser:</p> <pre><code>def myparser_consumer_declaration(sender, **kwargs):\n    return {\n        \"parser\": MyCustomParser,\n        \"weight\": 0,\n        \"mime_types\": {\n            \"application/pdf\": \".pdf\",\n            \"image/jpeg\": \".jpg\",\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre> <ul> <li><code>parser</code> is a reference to a class that extends <code>DocumentParser</code>.</li> <li><code>weight</code> is used whenever two or more parsers are able to parse a     file: The parser with the higher weight wins. This can be used to     override the parsers provided by Paperless-ngx.</li> <li><code>mime_types</code> is a dictionary. The keys are the mime types your     parser supports and the value is the default file extension that     Paperless-ngx should use when storing files and serving them for     download. We could guess that from the file extensions, but some     mime types have many extensions associated with them and the Python     methods responsible for guessing the extension do not always return     the same value.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"development/#using-visual-studio-code-devcontainer","title":"Using Visual Studio Code devcontainer","text":"<p>Another easy way to get started with development is to use Visual Studio Code devcontainers.

You might want to have     this somewhere else. Likewise, <code>PAPERLESS_DATA_DIR</code> and     <code>PAPERLESS_MEDIA_ROOT</code> define where paperless stores its data.     If you like, you can point both to the same directory.</li> <li><code>PAPERLESS_SECRET_KEY</code> should be a random sequence of     characters. It's used for authentication.

You may use     the service definition files included in the <code>scripts</code> folder as a     starting point.</p> <p>Paperless needs the <code>webserver</code> script to run the webserver, the <code>consumer</code> script to watch the input folder, <code>taskqueue</code> for the background workers used to handle things like document consumption and the <code>scheduler</code> script to run tasks such as email checking at certain times .</p> <p>Note</p> <p>The <code>socket</code> script enables <code>granian</code> to run on port 80 without root privileges. For this you need to uncomment the <code>Require=paperless-webserver.socket</code> in the <code>webserver</code> script and configure <code>granian</code> to listen on port 80 (set <code>GRANIAN_PORT</code>).</p> <p>These services rely on redis and optionally the database server, but don't need to be started in any particular order. The example files depend on redis being started. If you use a database server, you should add additional dependencies.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>For instructions on using a reverse proxy, see the wiki.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>If celery won't start (check with <code>sudo systemctl status paperless-task-queue.service</code> for paperless-task-queue.service and paperless-scheduler.service ) you need to change the path in the files. Example: <code>ExecStart=/opt/paperless/.local/bin/celery --app paperless worker --loglevel INFO</code></p> </li> <li> <p>Optional: Install a samba server and make the consumption folder     available as a network share.</p> </li> <li> <p>Configure ImageMagick to allow processing of PDF documents. Most     distributions have this disabled by default, since PDF documents can     contain malware. If you don't do this, paperless will fall back to     Ghostscript for certain steps such as thumbnail generation.</p> <p>Edit <code>/etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml</code> and adjust</p> <pre><code>&lt;policy domain=\"coder\" rights=\"none\" pattern=\"PDF\" /&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>to</p> <pre><code>&lt;policy domain=\"coder\" rights=\"read|write\" pattern=\"PDF\" /&gt;\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Optional: Install the     jbig2enc     encoder. This will reduce the size of generated PDF documents.     You'll most likely need to compile this by yourself, because this     software has been patented until around 2017 and binary packages are     not available for most distributions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Optional: If using the NLTK machine learning processing (see     <code>PAPERLESS_ENABLE_NLTK</code> for details),     download the NLTK data for the Snowball     Stemmer, Stopwords and Punkt tokenizer to <code>/usr/share/nltk_data</code>.

However, it is up to you to use them in a way that helps you organize documents and find specific documents when you need them. This section offers a couple ideas for managing your collection.</p> <p>Document types allow you to classify documents according to what they are. You can define types such as \"Receipt\", \"Invoice\", or \"Contract\". If you used to collect all your receipts in a single binder, you can recreate that system in paperless by defining a document type, assigning documents to that type and then filtering by that type to only see all receipts.</p> <p>Not all documents need document types. Sometimes its hard to determine what the type of a document is or it is hard to justify creating a document type that you only need once or twice. This is okay. As long as the types you define help you organize your collection in the way you want, paperless is doing its job.</p> <p>Tags can be used in many different ways. Think of tags are more versatile folders or binders. If you have a binder for documents related to university / your car or health care, you can create these binders in paperless by creating tags and assigning them to relevant documents. Just as with documents, you can filter the document list by tags and only see documents of a certain topic.</p> <p>With physical documents, you'll often need to decide which folder the document belongs to. The advantage of tags over folders and binders is that a single document can have multiple tags. A physical document cannot magically appear in two different folders, but with tags, this is entirely possible.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>This can be used in many different ways. One example: Imagine you're working on a particular task, such as signing up for university. Usually you'll need to collect a bunch of different documents that are already sorted into various folders. With the tag system of paperless, you can create a new group of documents that are relevant to this task without destroying the already existing organization. When you're done with the task, you could delete the tag again, which would be equal to sorting documents back into the folder they belong into. Or keep the tag, up to you.</p> <p>All of the logic above applies to correspondents as well. Attach them to documents if you feel that they help you organize your collection.</p> <p>When you've started organizing your documents, create a couple saved views for document collections you regularly access. This is equal to having labeled physical binders on your desk, except that these saved views are dynamic and simply update themselves as you add documents to the system.</p> <p>Here are a couple examples of tags and types that you could use in your collection.</p> <ul> <li>An <code>inbox</code> tag for newly added documents that you haven't manually     edited yet.</li> <li>A tag <code>car</code> for everything car related (repairs, registration,     insurance, etc)</li> <li>A tag <code>todo</code> for documents that you still need to do something with,     such as reply, or perform some task online.</li> <li>A tag <code>bank account x</code> for all bank statement related to that     account.</li> <li>A tag <code>mail</code> for anything that you added to paperless via its mail     processing capabilities.</li> <li>A tag <code>missing_metadata</code> when you still need to add some metadata to     a document, but can't or don't want to do this right now.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"usage/#basic-usage_searching","title":"Searching","text":""},{"location":"usage/#global-search","title":"Global search","text":"<p>The top search bar in the web UI performs a \"global\" search of the various objects Paperless-ngx uses, including documents, tags, workflows, etc. Only objects for which the user has appropriate permissions are returned.

Whenever you receive a document that you need to archive, put it into your inbox.

This applies to certain important documents, such as     contracts and certificates.</li> <li>If you need to keep the document, write a running number on the     document before scanning, starting at one and counting upwards.

You may start the webserver directly with</p> <pre><code>cd /path/to/paperless/src/\ngranian --interface asginl --ws \"paperless.asgi:application\"\n</code></pre> <p>or by any other means such as Apache <code>mod_wsgi</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>The consumer: This is what watches your consumption folder for     documents. However, the consumer itself does not really consume your     documents. Now it notifies a task processor that a new file is ready     for consumption. I suppose it should be named differently. This was     also used to check your emails, but that's now done elsewhere as     well.</p> <p>Start the consumer with the management command <code>document_consumer</code>:</p> <pre><code>cd /path/to/paperless/src/\npython3 manage.py document_consumer\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>The task processor: Paperless relies on Celery - Distributed     Task Queue for doing     most of the heavy lifting. This is a task queue that accepts tasks     from multiple sources and processes these in parallel. It also comes     with a scheduler that executes certain commands periodically.</p> <p>This task processor is responsible for:</p> <ul> <li>Consuming documents. When the consumer finds new documents, it     notifies the task processor to start a consumption task.</li> <li>The task processor also performs the consumption of any     documents you upload through the web interface.</li> <li>Consuming emails. It periodically checks your configured     accounts for new emails and notifies the task processor to     consume the attachment of an email.</li> <li>Maintaining the search index and the automatic matching     algorithm. These are things that paperless needs to do from time     to time in order to operate properly.</li> </ul> <p>This allows paperless to process multiple documents from your consumption folder in parallel! On a modern multi core system, this makes the consumption process with full OCR blazingly fast.</p> <p>The task processor comes with a built-in admin interface that you can use to check whenever any of the tasks fail and inspect the errors (i.e., wrong email credentials, errors during consuming a specific file, etc).</p> </li> <li> <p>A redis message broker: This is a really     lightweight service that is responsible for getting the tasks from     the webserver and the consumer to the task scheduler. These run in a     different process (maybe even on different machines!), and     therefore, this is necessary.</p> </li> <li> <p>Optional: A database server.
