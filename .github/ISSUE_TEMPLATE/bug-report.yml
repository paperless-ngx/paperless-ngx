        ### ⚠️ Please remember: issues are for *bugs*
        That is, something you believe affects every single user of Paperless-ngx, not just you. If you're not sure, start with one of the other options below.

        Also, note that **Paperless-ngx does not perform OCR or archive file creation itself**, those are handled by other tools. Problems with OCR or archive versions of specific files should likely be raised 'upstream', see https://github.com/ocrmypdf/OCRmyPDF/issues or https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues
